# React, Redux & Sass - Task

A simple and quick way to get you going with developing React applications with Redux and Sass.

**Code:**

For a complex example with Async actions, take a look at: [react-redux](https://github.com/DarshanKumar89/01People)

### Components ðŸ”© Styles ðŸŽ¨ Action! ðŸŽ¬

All the required code (JS + Sass) goes inside the `src` folder. Webpack will compile, bundle and output in the `public` folder, which you can upload/deploy to the root directory of your web server to publish your app!

**API ISSUes:**

```
1. The API Given [ https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/] Used to Add post- does add post but the server endpoint doent Update

2. So i just made a work around so it looks like faking but it fakes by removing the post
```

### Get started!

```
git clone
cd 01People
npm i
```

### Start the dev server:

```
npm run start:dev
```

### Build:

```
npm run build
```

#### Note:

- Changes made to your CSS / JS triggers a full page auto-reload.
- Running a build writes the `bundle.js` and `bundle.css` to the `/public/dist/` directory.

### Pre-configured tools and plugins

- Module bundler: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- ES6 Transpiler: [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
- Linting: [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- JS Uglification: [UglifyJsPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin/)
- Dev Server: [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) (`npm run start:dev`)
